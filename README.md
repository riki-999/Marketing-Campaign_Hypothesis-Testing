## A/B Testing on the Marketing Campaign 
This project is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) for the clients' advertising campaigns.

Conducted two ad campaigns, one on Facebook and the other on AdWords, and we need to determine which platform yields better results in terms of clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness. By identifying the most effective platform, allocate our resources more efficiently and optimize our advertising strategies to deliver better outcomes for our clients.
## Research Question
Which ad platform is more effective in terms of conversions, clicks, and overall cost-effectiveness?
## Method Used
Hypothesis testing is a fundamental concept in statistics that allows you to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It involves making an initial assumption (the null hypothesis) and then determining whether the data provides sufficient evidence to reject this assumption in favor of an alternative hypothesis.
## But, Why Hypothesis Testing is Valuable in Marketing Campaigns???
1. **Measure Effectiveness:**
   
    Determine whether a new marketing strategy or campaign is more effective than the current one by testing the null hypothesis that the new marketing campaign has the same click-through rate (CTR) as the current campaign against the alternative hypothesis that the new campaign has a higher CTR, businesses can quantify the impact of their campaigns and decide whether to implement changes or continue with the existing strategy.

2. **Optimize Ad Spend:**
   
    Ensure that marketing budgets are allocated to the most effective channels by testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference in conversion rates between ads run on Facebook and those on Google AdWords against the alternative hypothesis that ads on Facebook have a higher conversion rate, businesses can determine which platform provides better ROI and adjust their spending accordingly.

3. **Understand Audience Preferences:**
   
    Identify which ad creatives resonate more with the target audience. By testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference in engagement (likes, shares, comments) between Ad Creative A and Ad Creative B on Facebook against the alternative hypothesis that Ad Creative A has higher engagement, businesses can tailor their content to better meet audience preferences, enhancing campaign effectiveness.

4. **Improve Conversion Rates:**
   
    Increase the conversion rates of landing pages linked to ads. By testing the null hypothesis that the landing page design does not affect the conversion rate against the alternative hypothesis that the new landing page design increases the conversion rate, businesses can scientifically validate changes to landing pages, leading to better performance and higher conversions.

5. **Reduce Wastage:**
    
    Identify and eliminate underperforming ads or keywords by testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference in performance between high-cost and low-cost keywords against the alternative hypothesis that high-cost keywords generate more conversions, businesses can reallocate their budget to more effective options, reducing wasted ad spend.

6. **Enhance Customer Insights:**
   
    Gain deeper insights into customer behavior and preferences. By testing the null hypothesis that user demographics (age, gender, location) do not influence ad performance against the alternative hypothesis that certain user demographics respond better to specific types of ads, businesses can create targeted marketing strategies that improve overall campaign performance.

## Features

- A **symmetrical shape in a Histogram** suggests that the number of clicks and conversions is relatively evenly distributed, indicating that there are not many clicks or conversions that are outliers on either the high or low end.
- **Ad conversions** are divided into **four categories** based on the number of days to conversion, comparing performance between AdWords and Facebook.
- With the insights provided by the **Linear Regression model**, businesses can make informed decisions about resource allocation, budget planning, and campaign optimization.
- A **Correlation Coefficient** indicates a strong positive linear relationship between clicks on ads and sales.
- Used **Cointegration Test Score** to determine whether advertising spending and conversion rates are cointegrated, meaning they have a long-term equilibrium relationship despite being non-stationary on their own.

## Usage

>**How frequently do we observe days with high conversions compared to days with low conversions?**

>**Do more clicks on the ad really lead to more sales?**

>**How many Facebook ad conversions can I expect given a certain number of Facebook ad clicks?**

>**At what times of the month or days of the week do we observe the conversions?**

>**How does the Cost Per Conversion (CPC) trend over time?**

>**Is there a long-term equilibrium relationship between advertising spend and conversion rates that suggests a stable, proportional impact of budget changes on conversions over time?**
